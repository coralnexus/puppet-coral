## Overview

General purpose Puppet framework that focuses on extensibility and
compatibility between 2.x / 3.x and Hiera / non-Hiera systems.

This module provides a core framework for building and utilizing other
Puppet modules.  It also installs misc packages and utilities that do not
fit neatly into specialized bundles and creates and manages custom Facter
facts that are loaded through the user environment.  Finally it manages the
general security procedures and tools on a server, among the most important
functions are creating an extensible firewall rule system and a locked down
default.
